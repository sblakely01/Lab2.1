## Reflection

### 1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?

For me, the hardest accessibility enhancements to implement were the Aria Roles and Semantic HTML because I have experience coding in html but had not learned these enhancements before. I am still finding ways to remember the tags like main and section.

### 2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?

Aria attributes help screen readers and other assistive technologies to better understand the purpose of different parts of the page and can help users to understand and identify them.

### 3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

For checking color contrast, I used WebAIM Contrast Checker to check color contrast. It was really helpful because it gives you a rating for the contrast which helped me to compare options when trying to choose colors to use.
